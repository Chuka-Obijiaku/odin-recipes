    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 375 and spray a 9x13
        </li>
        <li>
            In a 5 quart dutch oven, add vegetable oil to coat the bottom and heat over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add in the meat and sear for 2-3 minutes. Flip and sear on the other 
            side until browned. Mash the meat using a potato masher. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Let the meat cook over medium-high heat until the fat renders out and 
            the meat is a bit crispy. Remove from the pot and place to the side.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add olive oil to the pot and add in the diced sweet onion. Season with salt and 
            saute for 3 minutes. Add in finely chopped garlic and saute for 20 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the meat back to the pot and mix to combine. Add in crushed 
            tomatoes, stir together, and let simmer for 5 minutes. Season with sugar 
            to cut the tomato acidity. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Separately, fill a pot with water and season generously with salt. 
            Once water is boiling add to the pasta. Cook just under al dente. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Using a spider, transfer the pasta to the sauce and stir to combine. 
        </li>
        <li>
            For the cheese mixture, grate all the cheeses and toss them together. 
        </li>
        <li>
            In the 9x13 greased baking dish, add in half of the pasta & sauce 
            evenly spreading out. Add full-fat ricotta on top followed by half of 
            the cheese mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the other half of pasta and sauce, topped with the other half of 
            ricotta, and the other half of the cheese mixture. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the dish into the 375F oven for 35 minutes. Remove and let cool completely
